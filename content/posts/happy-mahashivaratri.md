# Happy Mahashivaratri!

Mahashivaratri is a Hindu festival celebrated annually to worship the deity Shiva, between February and March. This year in 2026 it started on 15th February 2026 and ended on 16th March 2026.

## Who is Shiva? (A Poem)

``That which does not die is Shiva.``

``Shava is not Shiva. Blissful one is Shiva.``

``The body is not Shiva. The being is Shiva.``

``The part is not Shiva. The whole is Shiva.``

``Shunya is Poorna. Poorna is Shunya.``

``Shunya is Shiva. Shiva is Poorna.``

``That which dies is not Shiva. Ignorance is not Shiva. Ahankara is not Shiva.``

``That which does not die is Shiva. Pure Consciousness is Shiva. Awareness is Shiva.``

``Shiva is in all beings. All beings are in Shiva.``

``He is there in all of us as Shivatman. He is a potential that can become actual.``

``Shiva is all. All is Shiva. Shivaratri is a celebration of that realization.``

``Happy Mahashivaratri.``

## Quote

What is Shiva?

> That which is not is Shiva. Shiva is not a form. Shiva is formless and nameless. He is beyond Nama and Rupa. He is there in all of us as Shivatman. He is a potential that can become actual. He is Shunya and Poorna.
