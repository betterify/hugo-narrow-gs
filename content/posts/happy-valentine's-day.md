# Happy Valentine's Day!

Today is Valentine's Day. It is celebrated annually on February 14. It an occasion dedicated to expressing love, affection, and friendship.

I am sharing here one of my poems, tittled, "What is Love?."

## What is Love? (A Poem)

### I love you to the moon, babe!

``There is only love.``

``You fall in love.``

``You grow in love.``

``You don’t drown in love.``

``You are a beggar when you seek love.``

``You become an emperor when you give love.``

``But giving and receiving are like a business.``

``It represents duality.``

``It is conditional.``

``When you embody love, you become divine.``

``It is unconditional.``

``It is you.``

``It is your very nature.``

``I am within you.``

``You are within me.``

``I am yours.``

``You are mine.``

``I am you.``

``You are me.``

``We are not separate.``

``We are Oneness.``

``We are two bodies in one Soul.``

## Quote

What is true love?

> Love is Divine. It is transformational. It is body to body. It is mind to mind. It is heart to heart. It is soul to soul. It is physical. It is intellectual. It is emotional. And it is spiritual. Love is a change agent.
