# Mrinank Sharma and Anthropic

It is 9th February 2026. Today is Mrinank's last day in Anthropic. He resigns as the Head of AI Safety at Anthropic. He shares his resignation letter in a X-post explaining his decision. I think he was unhappy with what was going on in the world of AI. He wishes to pursue PhD in Poetry.

Even Geoffrey Hinton, who is called the Godfather of AI, left Google in the year 2023 to freely speak out about the serious risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI).

## My View

> [!NOTE]
> At this moment when AI is accelerating, the AI safety issue is of paramount importance. These brilliant minds in the world of AI should stay there and ensure AI safety, standards, and regulations.

# My response to his post

My response to his X-post reads as under:

> I saw and read some of your poems. I read your poem titled, 'This is how you find yourself'. And then I penned mine, just now, in response, titled, "How do you find yourself?" Never give up. Then, it is the same as Arjuna. A Zen poet has to be a Samurai. All the best of luck!

## How do you find yourself? (A Poem)

``Fire burns your body. It burns your brain. And you die.``

``But it doesn’t burn your mind. The brain and the mind are distinct entities.``

``Awareness doesn’t burn your body. It doesn’t burn your brain.``

``But it burns the impurities of your mind. It burns your conditioning. It burns your Sanskaras.``

``Now you are free from the bondage of the past. You are new. Rejuvenated and rekindled.``

``The snake has shed its old skin. You are born again in the same body. You are not the same person.``

``You are now an individual in union with the Divine. You are a new you. Awareness helps you see the immortal.``

## Note

> The above poem was written by me on 12th of February 2026.

## Quote

Who is a Zen poet?

> Poetry is of the heart ❤️ Zen masters teach that the pure mind is an eternal Buddha nature. You should never give up. To me, a Zen poet has to be a Samurai.

## Sanskrit Words

*Sanskaras:* Mental Impressions, Subconscious Impressions, Behavioral inclinations formed by past actions.

*Arjuna:* Bright, Shining, White, Clear. These are literal meanings of the word. Arjuna was the third Pandava brother in Mahabharata. He was the master archer. He received the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita from Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
